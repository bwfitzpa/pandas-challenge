# pandas-challenge
Inside the PyCitySchools folder there is both the code and the report for the assignment.
The file PyCitySchools.ipynb has the code I wrote for the assignment, producing the required dataframes, as well as notations for sources.
The document Written_Report_Pandas_Challeng.docx has the written report including my analysis and screen shots of the tables that were produced.
